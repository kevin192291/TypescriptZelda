# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This is supposed to be a fun game, and we will keep politics
out of the game. If this is not want you want. Feel free to
fork the game, and do what ever you want with it :)
This document template was full of "gender inclusivity" stuff
and I don't know nor do I care how that factors into programming
a game. So if anyone has a better Code of Conduct, feel free
to update this and PR it.

Thanks
